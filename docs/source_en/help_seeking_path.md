  - After joining the group, discuss with other users. Technical experts in the group can also provide answers.
  - Resolve the problem by asking experts or communicating with other users.


- Forum Help-Seeking

  - If you want a detailed solution, start a help post on the [MindSpore forum](https://bbs.huaweicloud.com/forum/forum-1076-1.html).
  - To improve the speed and quality of problem solving, refer to [post suggestions](https://bbs.huaweicloud.com/forum/thread-69695-1-1.html) before posting.
  - After the post is sent, a forum moderator collects the question and contacts technical experts to answer the question. The question will be resolved within three working days.
