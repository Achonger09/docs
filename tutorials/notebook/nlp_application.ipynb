    "## 概述\n",
    "\n",
    "情感分类是自然语言处理中文本分类问题的子集，属于自然语言处理最基础的应用。它是对带有感情色彩的主观性文本进行分析和推理的过程，即分析说话人的态度，是倾向正面还是反面。\n",
    "\n",
    "> 通常情况下，我们会把情感类别分为正面、反面和中性三类。虽然“面无表情”的评论也有不少；不过，大部分时候会只采用正面和反面的案例进行训练，下面这个数据集就是很好的例子。\n",
    "\n",
    "传统的文本主题分类问题的典型参考数据集为[20 Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)，该数据集由20组新闻数据组成，包含约20000个新闻文档。\n",
    "其主题列表中有些类别的数据比较相似，例如comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware和comp.sys.mac.hardware都是和电脑系统硬件相关的题目，相似度比较高。而有些主题类别的数据相对来说就毫无关联，例如misc.forsale和soc.religion.christian。\n",
    "\n",
    "就网络本身而言，文本主题分类的网络结构和情感分类的网络结构大致相似。在掌握了情感分类网络如何构造之后，很容易可以构造一个类似的网络，稍作调参即可用于文本主题分类任务。\n",
    "\n",
    "但在业务上下文侧，文本主题分类是分析文本讨论的客观内容，而情感分类是要从文本中得到它是否支持某种观点的信息。比如，“《阿甘正传》真是好看极了，影片主题明确，节奏流畅。”这句话，在文本主题分类是要将其归为类别为“电影”主题，而情感分类则要挖掘出这一影评的态度是正面还是负面。\n",
    "\n",
    "相对于传统的文本主题分类，情感分类较为简单，实用性也较强。常见的购物网站、电影网站都可以采集到相对高质量的数据集，也很容易给业务领域带来收益。例如，可以结合领域上下文，自动分析特定类型客户对当前产品的意见，可以分主题分用户类型对情感进行分析，以作针对性的处理，甚至基于此进一步推荐产品，提高转化率，带来更高的商业收益。\n",
    "\n",
    "特殊领域中，某些非极性词也充分表达了用户的情感倾向，比如下载使用APP时，“卡死了”、“下载太慢了”就表达了用户的负面情感倾向；股票领域中，“看涨”、“牛市”表达的就是用户的正面情感倾向。所以，本质上，我们希望模型能够在垂直领域中，挖掘出一些特殊的表达，作为极性词给情感分类系统使用：\n",
    "\n",
    "$垂直极性词 = 通用极性词 + 领域特有极性词$\n",
    "\n",
    "按照处理文本的粒度不同，情感分析可分为词语级、短语级、句子级、段落级以及篇章级等几个研究层次。这里以“段落级”为例，输入为一个段落，输出为影评是正面还是负面的信息。\n",
    "\n",
    "接下来，以IMDB影评情感分类为例来体验MindSpore在自然语言处理上的应用。"

    "| \"Quitting\" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. As a rural guy coming to Beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success. Troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. The ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other.  |  Negative |  \n",
